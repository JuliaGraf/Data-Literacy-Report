Put your abstract here. Abstracts typically start with a sentence motivating why the subject is interesting. Then mention the data, methodology or methods you are working with, and describe results.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Motivate the problem, situation or topic you decided to work on. Describe why it matters (is it of societal, economic, scientific value?). Outline the rest of the paper (use references, e.g.~to \Cref{sec:methods}: What kind of data you are working with, how you analyse it, and what kind of conclusion you reached. The point of the introduction is to make the reader want to read the rest of the paper.

\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

For the analysis of the influence of precipitation on the amount of visitors we used four different datasets. All the datasets are from the Open Data Server of the German Meteorological Service (DWD) and contain data from the weatherstations ''München-Stadt'' and ''München (Bavariaring)''. Two of the datasets contain daily weather data. One of these contains historical data from 1954 to 2022, the other recent data from 2022 to 2024. We only used the daily precipitation data which is given in milimeter. The other two datasets contain hourly precipiation data. One is historical and reaches from 1997 to 2022, while the recent one reaches from 2022 till 2024. The precipitation here is given in milimeter per hour per day as well.\\
To analyze wether there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation at the octoberfest and the amount of visitors we used the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The PCC can take numbers between minus one and one. The greater the absolute value of that number is, the greater is the correlation between the two variables that are being studied. In our case we investigate the correlation between the daily mean visitors at the octoberfest in each year and the daily mean precipitation at the octoberfest in each year, as well as the daily mean precipitation between 10am and 10pm in each year.\\

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
For the analysis of the influence of precipitation on the amount of visitors we used four different datasets. All the datasets are from the Open Data Server of the German Meteorological Service (DWD) and contain data from the weatherstations ''München-Stadt'' and ''München (Bavariaring)''. Two of the datasets contain daily weather data. One of these contains historical data from 1954 to 2022, the other recent data from 2022 to 2024. We only used the daily precipitation data which is given in milimeter. The other two datasets contain hourly precipiation data. One is historical and reaches from 1997 to 2022, while the recent one reaches from 2022 till 2024. The precipitation here is given in milimeter per hour per day as well.\\
To analyze wether there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation at the octoberfest and the amount of visitors we used the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The PCC can take numbers between minus one and one. The greater the absolute value of that number is, the greater is the correlation between the two variables that are being studied. In our case we investigate the correlation between the daily mean visitors at the octoberfest in each year and the daily mean precipitation at the octoberfest in each year, as well as the daily mean precipitation between 10am and 10pm in each year.\\
\subsection*{Results}
The PCC we computed for the mean daily visitors and the mean daily precipitation in each year is around -0.1913. The correlation is negative. As the amount of precipitation increases the amount of visitors decrease. Since the absolute value of the PCC is quite low but not zero the correlation between the variables is weak. Due to the fact that the precipitaion here includes hours of the day were the octoberfest isn't open we also investigated if the mean precipitation at day time correlates with the amount of visitors stronger. We therefor considered the precipitation between 10am and 10pm. The PCC than is around -0.2276. So it gets stronger but is still weak.

  \label{figure_precipitation}
\end{figure*}\\
\noindent
In Figure~\ref{figure_precipitation} we can see the weak negative correlation in the green regression line which has a negative gradient while the values at both axis increas. The regression line shows that the mean daily amount of visitors of the octoberfest decrease by around 25.000 people as the mean precipitation at day time increases from zero milimeters to seven.\\


\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The PCC is weak for the mean precipitation at day time and the mean daily vistors. This can have many reasons. One reason is, that we looked at the correlation of the mean over all days for each octoberfest and not at the correlation between the precipitation at each day and the visitor number of each day due to the lack of data. If in one year there is a very rainy day at which fewer people visit followed by good days with no rain were all the vistors come instead we couldn't see that the people that visited were influenced by the precipitation when only using the mean. Due to that even a weak correaltion shows that the amount of precipitation influences the amount of vistors. ........ In conclusion we can say, that the amount of precipitation influences the amount of visitors, but there are factors that influence the amount of precipitatioin more.\\

\section*{Contribution Statement}

Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member contributed. For example, you could write: Max Mustermann collected and prepared data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe performed the data analysis. Jane Doe produced visualizations. All authors will jointly wrote the text of the report. Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.

\section*{Notes} 

Your entire report has a \textbf{hard page limit of 4 pages} excluding references. (I.e. any pages beyond page 4 must only contain references). Appendices are \emph{not} possible. But you can put additional material, like interactive visualizations or videos, on a githunb repo (use \href{https://github.com/pnkraemer/tueplots}{links} in your pdf to refer to them). Each report has to contain \textbf{at least three plots or visualizations}, and \textbf{cite at least two references}. More details about how to prepare the report, inclucing how to produce plots, cite correctly, and how to ideally structure your github repo, will be discussed in the lecture, where a rubric for the evaluation will also be provided.
